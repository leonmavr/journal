## Instructions
Each topic can be read from its pdf file. Notes follow the note-taking template. For Latex, the bibliography backend is `bibtex` and they should be able to be compiled by:
```
$ python compile.py <file_name_without_extension>
```
If warnings should be ignored, then the following can be used:
```
$ yes "" | python compile.py <file_name_without_extension>
```
